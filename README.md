=========

I tutor some kids in math and they have all sorts of worksheets to do that are pretty much the same. I wanted to be able to give them more problems of a certain type without having to make up a bunch of numbers. As it turns out, they dig putting it into the computer and having a score. It really helps them to stop guessing and actually try to solve the problem. I know there are a bunch of these around, but most of the kids didn't even know you could do this with a computor. So being able to have them suggest something then program it and show them how I did that is really neat to them.
